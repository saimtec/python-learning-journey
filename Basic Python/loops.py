# loops make our work easy there are two loops while and for 


# i=1
# while(i<=5):         #in while() the condition should be like which become false after sometime otherwise our program will stuck in infinite loop
#     print(i)
#     i=i+1

# # print content of list through while loop
# li=["abc",123,"saim", "nida","haider","broken"]
# x=0
# while(x<len(li)):
#     print(li[x])
#     x=x+1



# for loop
# we can use for loop in string ,tuple,list for iterate
# there is a range function in for loop which goes to n-1
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# # we can do slicing in for loop
# for i in range(0,100,5):
#     print(i)

# # for loop in sting
# a="saim"
# for i in a:
#     print(i)

# # for loop in list
# lis=["abc",123,"saim", "nida","haider","broken"]
# for i in lis:
#     print(i)

# # for loop in tuple
# t=(1,222,34,34,45,56)
# for i in t:
#     print(i)

# # we can use for llop with else
# tu=(1,222,34,34,45,56)
# for i in tu:
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print("completed")




# break , continue
# for i in range(10):
#     if(i==8):       #break will stop iteration on 8
#         break
#     print(i)

# for i in range(10):
#     if(i==8):       #continue will skip this iteration 8
#         continue
#     print(i)
