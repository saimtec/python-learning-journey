    "# üìù Project: Polymorphic Employee Payroll System (OOP in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the difference between **concrete classes** and **abstract classes**.\n",
    "* Learn how to design and implement an **inheritance hierarchy**.\n",
    "* Use **polymorphism** to calculate payroll for different employee types.\n",
    "* Apply and define the Python abstract base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Statement: Employee Payroll System\n",
    "\n",
    "A company pays employees weekly. There are two employee types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Salaried Employees** ‚Üí paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of hours worked.\n",
    "2. **Hourly Employees** ‚Üí paid by the hour; any hours beyond 40 are considered **overtime** (paid at 1.5√ó hourly wage).\n",
    "\n",
    "The company wants a payroll system that uses **polymorphism** so that regardless of the employee type, the system can calculate and display earnings **through a common interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Class Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Base Class: `Employee`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represents the **general concept of an employee**.\n",
    "* Defines attributes **common to all employees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `first_name`, `last_name`, `ssn` (Social Security Number).\n",
    "* Declares an abstract method `earnings()` (to be overridden in subclasses).\n",
    "* Provides a `__repr__` method to return employee details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete Subclass: `SalariedEmployee`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inherits from `Employee`.\n",
    "* Additional attribute: `weekly_salary`.\n",
    "* `earnings()` returns the fixed weekly salary.\n",
    "* Weekly salary must be **non-negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete Subclass: `HourlyEmployee`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inherits from `Employee`.\n",
    "* Additional attributes: `hours`, `wage_per_hour`.\n",
    "* `earnings()` calculates:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Normal pay = `hours √ó wage_per_hour` (if `hours <= 40`).\n",
    "  * Overtime pay = `40 √ó wage_per_hour + (hours-40) √ó 1.5 √ó wage_per_hour`.\n",
    "* `hours` must be in range **0‚Äì168**.\n",
    "* `wage_per_hour` must be **non-negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Assignment Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the **abstract base class `Employee`** using Python‚Äôs `abc` module.\n",
    "2. Implement the **concrete subclasses `SalariedEmployee` and `HourlyEmployee`**.\n",
    "3. In an interactive session or script:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Try creating an `Employee` object ‚Üí it should raise a `TypeError`.\n",
    "   * Create objects of `SalariedEmployee` and `HourlyEmployee`.\n",
    "   * Print their details using `__repr__`.\n",
    "   * Print their `earnings()`.\n",
    "4. Place both objects in a **list** and iterate through them, calling `earnings()` polymorphically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Example Run\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SalariedEmployee: John Doe, SSN: 123-45-6789, Weekly Salary: 800.0\n",
    "Earnings: 800.0\n",
    "\n",
    "HourlyEmployee: Jane Smith, SSN: 987-65-4321, Hours: 50, Wage: 20.0\n",
    "Earnings: 1100.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Deliverable**: A Python script (`payroll.py`) that defines the classes and demonstrates polymorphic payroll calculation as described.\n",
